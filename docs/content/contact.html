  <p>
    We like to play at your favourite rat hole of a bar, squad, garage, rehearsal room or concert hall.
    Just kick your lazy friends' asses so they can help you set up a show.
    We just need food, drinks, places to sleep and - capitalism never sleeps - gas money.

    To set up a show or to simply insult us - write us an email:
